This is a fork of Yii 1.1.8 with a skeleton project created in public-html.

The base structure of this skeleton answer some security concerns:
- Moved ~/webroot/protected above the /webroot to ~/protected
- Moved ~/webroot/protected/runtime to ~/runtime

The additions to the framework include the following: 
- Pre-configured to use SASS
- Updated to jQuery 1.6.2
- Includes a custom port of the Facebook PHP SDK 3.0 (todo: update to latest verion of SDK)
- Provides valid P3P headers for SSL connections for older versions of IE to get around security restrictions for third-party cookies
- Channel controller to eliminate Facebook JS bugs
- Amazon S3 support
- cURL library extension
- Added isMobile() function to base controller for generic test for mobile devices
- Added fire() function to base controller for Firebug trace support + custom log route in config/main.php for YII_DEBUG
